- Added another parameter to Fetcher.Fetch; "method". This determines what HTTP Method Fetcher will use at that endpoint. 
- Removed cafe.clientEventReceived as it was unnecessary; using Cafe.setClientEventListeners instead. 

- Candidate for Refactor: Fetcher.getAndClearResponses to Fetcher.popResponses
- Candidate for Refactor: CafeNavBar to something that encompasses the fact that it holds all the windows as well, not just the nav. Perhaps "CafeNavigator" or just "Navigator"
