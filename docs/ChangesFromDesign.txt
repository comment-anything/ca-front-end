- Added another parameter to Fetcher.Fetch; "method". This determines what HTTP Method Fetcher will use at that endpoint. 
- Removed cafe.clientEventReceived as it was unnecessary; using Cafe.setClientEventListeners instead. 

- cafe.userChange moved to State.loadProfile
- CafeNavBar.DisplayMessage removed, instead will be accessed via CafeNavBar.message.displayMessage
- (changed on the backend) ServerResponse.t and .d to .Name and .Data

- Candidate for Refactor: Fetcher.getAndClearResponses to Fetcher.popResponses
- Candidate for Refactor: CafeNavBar to something that encompasses the fact that it holds all the windows as well, not just the nav. Perhaps "CafeNavigator" or just "Navigator"
